# Tasks

Let
  X be an RV and
  logistic(x) := 1/(1+exp(-x)) be the standard logistic function.
Find a counterexample to the claim
  E[logistic(X)] > logistic(E[X]) if E[X] < 0,
where E[.] denotes the expectation.
Next, for mu < 0 and sigma > 0 prove the claim
  E[logistic(X)] > logistic(E[X]) if X ~ N(mu, sigma^2),
i.e. if X is normally distributed with negative mean mu and variance sigma^2.

# Comments

* Constructing the counterexample should help you identify the properties of
the normal distribution that you need to exploit to prove the second claim.
* This problem is something that came up in the last weeks. It is unclear how
prevalent or important similar problems will be in the future. Meaning that if
you like to and can solve similar problems that's good, but otherwise it's not
bad.
* This is not an exam and I don't want you to treat the problem like an exam
question. Meaning
  * you can use whatever help or resources you can find online or elsewhere, as
  long as you verify them, can explain why they are correct and reference them
  appropriately,
  * you don't need to show every computation, but you do need to show every
  logical step in the proof,
  * if anything is unclear or you are stuck somewhere, you can always ask me
  for clarification or help, and in fact I would prefer if you openly and
  quickly communicated any problems that you might have.
