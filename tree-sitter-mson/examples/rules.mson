Binary operations:

  a = b
  a != b
  a >= b
  a <= b
  a - b
  a + b
  a / b
  a * b
  a := b

Function calls:
  f(x)
  f[x]
Tuples: (trailing comma needed for single element tuple)
  (a,) (trailing comma needed)
  (a,b)
  (a,b,)
  (a,b,c)
  (a,b,c,)
Lists: (trailing comma optional)
  [a] (trailing comma not needed)
  [a,]
Sets: (trailing comma needed for single element set)
  {a,} (trailing comma needed)
  {a,b}
  {a,b,c}

# Currently not parsed implicitly:

# Enable explicit parsing:

Wrap an expression in curly braces:

What if there is a, b, c and a comma?
  vs
What if there is {a}, {b}, {c} and a comma?
